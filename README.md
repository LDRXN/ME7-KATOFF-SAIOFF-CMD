# 🚗 ME7 CDKAT / CDSLS DISABLER

**Disable Catalyst (CDKAT) and Secondary Air Injection (CDSLS) DTC switches in Bosch ME7 / ME7.5 ECU firmware.**

A lightweight command-line utility that automatically locates and safely disables **CDKAT** and **CDSLS** diagnostic switches using original Bosch ME7 code patterns.

The original BIN file is **never overwritten**, making the modification process safe and straightforward.

---

# ✨ Features

* ✅ Automatic **CDKAT** detection
* ✅ Automatic **CDSLS** detection
* ✅ Supports Bosch **ME7 / ME7.5** ECUs
* ✅ Automatic ECU information detection
* ✅ Safe pattern-based switch identification
* ✅ Scan-only mode
* ✅ Automatic checksum correction using **ME7Sum**
* ✅ Original BIN file is never overwritten
* ✅ Detailed operation log
* ✅ Windows executable included

---

# 📦 Usage

## Disable CDKAT & CDSLS

```text
Kat_Sai_OFF.exe dump.bin
```

## Scan only

```text
Kat_Sai_OFF.exe dump.bin --SCANONLY
```

or

```text
Kat_Sai_OFF.exe dump.bin -s
```

---

# 📁 Output

The original BIN file is **never modified**.

The program creates:

```text
dump_CDKAT_CDSLS_OFF.bin
```

If **ME7Sum** is available in the same directory, an additional checksum-corrected BIN file is automatically generated.

---

# ⚙️ Requirements

* Windows
* Bosch **ME7 / ME7.5** firmware
* `me7sum.exe` *(optional but highly recommended)*

To enable automatic checksum correction, simply place **me7sum.exe** in the same directory as **Kat_Sai_OFF.exe**.

---

# ⚠️ Important

**Never flash a modified BIN file with an invalid checksum.**

If checksum correction fails or **ME7Sum** is missing, the generated BIN **must not be flashed**.

Always verify the modified firmware before programming the ECU.
